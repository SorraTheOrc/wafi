Canonical PRD: docs/dev/opencode_integration_PRD.md

Session triage completed — see the PRD for full scope, acceptance criteria, and deliverables.

Note: The PRD references the package manifest at config/waif_pacakges.yaml (preserves the preferred filename). Child issues wf-gn7.* remain present, open, and unassigned.
