Implementation performed by patch (Map orchestrated)

Files created/edited:
- src/lib/ooda-ingester.ts (edited/created) — ingester, mapping, redaction, append
- src/lib/opencode.ts (existing) — readMockEvents already present and used
- src/commands/ooda.ts (edited) — added --mock wiring to runIngester
- tests/ooda-parser.test.ts (existing) — uses new functions
- tests/ooda-ingester.integration.test.ts (existing) — integration test for mock path
- tests/ooda-cli-opencode.test.ts (existing) — ensures CLI forwards flags

Commands executed by Map:
- bd update wf-r1d.10 --status in_progress --assignee patch
- Created history/wf-r1d.10-plan.txt
- Launched patch agent to implement files (local edits only; no git commits or pushes performed)

Decisions taken:
- v1 persistence: append newline-delimited JSON to history/ooda_status.jsonl
- Redaction: keys containing token/password/secret/pem/key are replaced with '[REDACTED]' (case-insensitive, partial matches)

Remaining risks/follow-ups:
- Confirm rotation/archival for history/ooda_status.jsonl (create follow-up issue wf-r1d.11)
- Confirm secret redaction rules with security team; may need regex patterns for embedded secrets
- Add CLI documentation and PRD update if desired

Next bd steps recommended:
- bd sync (to save issue state and plan)
- Create branch and commit code changes
- Open PR referencing wf-r1d.10 and PRD
